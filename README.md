## ✅ Before VPN Connection – Speed Test
1. Show baseline internet speed and IP before VPN.  
2. Baseline speed test before connecting to VPN – shows original IP and normal speed performance.

## ✅ After VPN Connection – IP Verification
1. Prove that your IP and location changed after connecting to VPN.  
2. VPN connected (Windscribe – Hong Kong) – IP changed to `146.70.250.7` confirming successful VPN tunneling.

## ⚠️ After VPN Connection – Speed Test
1. Show the effect of VPN on internet speed.  
2. Speed test after VPN connection – shows increased latency and reduced speed due to encryption and rerouting.

## 📚 Key Learnings

1. VPN hides your IP address and encrypts traffic.  
2. VPN encryption (**AES-256**) ensures data privacy.  
3. **Limitations:** reduced speed, no absolute anonymity.  
4. Useful for securing public Wi-Fi and bypassing geo-restrictions.
